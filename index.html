            <p class="exp-p">Daredevil's life is a mix of joy and tragedy.The story of Matt Murdock began with his
               father. Jonathan
               "Battling Jack" Murdock raised his sons, Matt and Mike alone, claiming Matt's mother had died. Jack
               wanted
               his sons to be more successful than him. He impressed upon Matt the need to constantly study instead of
               playing sports with other kids. Jack hoped that Matt would become a doctor or a lawyer instead of an
               "uneducated pug" like himself. This led the neighborhood kids to bully the "cowardly" Matt as
               "Daredevil",
               while his twin brother came to his aid. Matt took out his frustrations by secretly training in his
               father's gym</p>

            <p class="exp-p">After became blind by accident, Matt received training from the ninja master Stick. From
               Stick, Matt
               learned
               how to control his new abilities and honed his skills in acrobatics and martial arts.

               Meanwhile, Jack Murdock was desperate to fight. He reluctantly joined with a crooked fight promoter known
               as
               the "Fixer." The Fixer set up Jack to be a heavyweight contender, just to have him take a dive. Jack
               refused
               and won his fight. Later that night, Jack Murdock was shot dead by the Fixer and his men.</p>
